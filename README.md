# MiniBank
This project was for Microcontrollers Application (MAPP) I did back in poly.

(i lost the video for the final prototype, it was coloured and we settled a holder for the Numpad too :( )

## Project Objective
We used the PIC18 microcontroller to come up with a fun bank to encourage kids to save.
Conventional piggy banks have typically been perceived as uninspiring, merely serving as receptacles for children to deposit their spare change. Therefore, we aspire to cultivate a culture of financial prudence by designing an engaging piggy bank that transforms the act of saving into an interactive and enjoyable experience for children, rendering it akin to a dynamic toy rather than a conventional, unadorned coin repository.

## Functions
1) Count the coins inserted
2) Updates the current bank amount
3) Select dispense amount
4) Displays the overall bank amount
   
## Implementation
I have used the PIC18 Microcontroller combined with an Arduino board for versatility to implement the project.

PIC18 handles the LCD Screen, Numpad inputs and sensing of coin inputted (20cents, 50cents).

Arduino handles the logic of coin dispensing, servo motor and dc motor controlls.


### Teamworks

**Prototype:**
As the prototype is hand-made by us using cardboards, we needed to refine the measurements:
1) Spinning wheel holes diameter to fit the coins
2) Angle of slopes for both the coin holder below the wheel and the one above where the coin rolls down
3) Attachment of sensors and rigidness so when in motion, does not bug out.
4) Diameter of each coin receiver
5) Servo Motor angles
6) Overall structure balance

Although it looks abit sluggish, but a lot of time was put into it ;-;

**Software:**

Me.

### MAPP Design Contest
Our team was selected to participate in the MAPP Design contest and we won Merit Prize!
