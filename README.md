# MiniBank
This project was for Microcontrollers Application (MAPP) I did back in poly.

(i lost the video for the final prototype, it was coloured and we settled a holder for the Numpad too :( )

## Project Objective
We used the PIC18 microcontroller to come up with a fun bank to encourage kids to save.
Conventional piggy banks have typically been perceived as uninspiring, merely serving as receptacles for children to deposit their spare change. Therefore, we aspire to cultivate a culture of financial prudence by designing an engaging piggy bank that transforms the act of saving into an interactive and enjoyable experience for children, rendering it akin to a dynamic toy rather than a conventional, unadorned coin repository.

## Functions
1) Count the coins inserted
2) Updates the current bank amount
3) Select dispense amount
4) Displays the overall bank amount
   
## Implementation
I have used the PIC18 Microcontroller combined with an Arduino board for versatility to implement the project.
PIC18 handles the LCD Screen, Numpad inputs and sensing of coin inputted (20cents, 50cents).
Arduino handles the logic of coin dispensing, servo motor and dc motor controlls.

### Teamworks
My teammates designed the cardbox prototypes.
I handled the codes.

### MAPP Design Contest
Our team was selected to participate in the MAPP Design contest and we won Merit Prize!
